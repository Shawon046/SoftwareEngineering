		\begin{itemize}
			\item Define an interface for creating an object but let the subclass decide which class to instantiate.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Code for interface rather than implementing concrete classes.
			\item Less coupling. provides the developer to add additional updates without changing main codes.
		\end{itemize}
